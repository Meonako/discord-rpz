# Why? What's the point?

Welp first, Zig is ***(as the time of writing this)*** very unstable. And I can't keep up with the changes so package manager is obviously a pain. 

So I decided that this will be a challenge to only use standard libs of Zig... and it IS still a pain since documentation is almost non-existent.

Luckily, I was able to find a solution on my own.
